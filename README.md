# rust-snake

The good old 🐍 snake game, in rust using bevy and _maybe_ build to wasm at the end of the process.

## About

This project is part of my journey learning rust while having some fun along the way. It is built on top of [rust-adventure/bevy-snake](https://github.com/rust-adventure/bevy-snake) with the relevant changes to account for newer rust and bevy versions.
